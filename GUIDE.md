## What are these avatars?

These avatars refers to the [Geometry Dash difficulties](https://www.reddit.com/r/geometrydash/comments/npmn0o/every_difficulty_in_a_nutshell/)

So, I was really boring about the original `README.md` user cards (only, letters and numbers), so I picked up some pixel arts to link to different levels, [all credits goes to the original author (r/pandwu)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/pandwu/geometry_dash_difficulty_faces_oc/)
